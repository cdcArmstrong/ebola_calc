    <string name="disclaimer">This calculator estimates <b>the period of time during which a person
        with Ebola virus disease may have been exposed to the virus.</b>\n\n
        This tool may be useful in guiding case investigations by helping to more
        reliably calculate the period during which the patient was likely to have
        been exposed to Ebola virus.\n\n
        <b>Important:</b> this only provides <b>an estimate</b> of the exposure window.
        The true exposure window may be different.\n\n
        The information provided by this tool need to be used in the context of
        other known information about the case in question.</string>
